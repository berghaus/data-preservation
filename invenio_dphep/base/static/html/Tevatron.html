<h1>Tevatron</h1>
<p>The Tevatron is a circular particle accelerator in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. </p>
<p>The 6.86 km circumference ring contains two detectors: CDF for Collider Detector at Fermilab and DZero. In 1995 CDF and DZero experiments announced discovery of the top quark.</p>
<p>The Tevatron ceased operations on 30 September 2011, due to budget cuts and because of the completion of the LHC, which began operations in early 2010 and was more powerful.</p>
