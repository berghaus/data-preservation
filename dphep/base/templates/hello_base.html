 # Macros
 #  * Make template blocks more clear so you don't clutter up a lot of HTML with
 #    rendering logic - e.g. you wouldn't put your Python code in one big
 #    function, instead you split it up into small functions with clearly
 #    defined responsibilities.
 #  * Macros can be parameterized.

    {# Macros can be overwritten in a child template, but only calls within the
     # child template will call the new macro. Hence, if you just want to
     # overwrite the action_bar macro in <module>/<name>.html, you must also
     # copy/paste the form_header and form_footer blocks where it's used,
     # otherwise the old macro will be used. To avoid this problem, please
     # just include a template inside the macro instead. This will allows another
     # Invenio installation to overwrite just this part.

{#
 # Blocks
 #  * Think of template-blocks as the API which other Invenio installations will
 #    use to customize the Invenio layout. An Invenio installation can override
 #    blocks defined in your templates so that they keep their own changes
 #    to a minimum, and don't copy/paste large parts of the template code.
 #  * Use blocks liberally - to allow customizations of your template.
 #  * Add the template block name to the {% endblock <name> %} to increase
 #    readability of template code.

{% block body %}
<div>
  <p>Hello {{name}}</p>
