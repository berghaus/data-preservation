<h1>Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)</h1>
<p>The RHIC is a heavy-ion  and  spin-polarized proton collider. It is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New-York and was started up in 2000.</p>
<p>RHICs double storage ring is itself hexagonally shaped and 3834Â m long in circumference, with curved edges in which stored particles are deflected and focused by 1,740 superconducting magnets.</p>
<p>There are four detectors at RHIC: STAR, PHENIX, PHOBOS and BRAHMS, the two last ones completed their operations in 2005, 2006 respectively.</p>
